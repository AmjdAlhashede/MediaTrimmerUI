# MediaTrimmer Compose UI 🎬

A lightweight and flexible UI toolkit for trimming **audio** and **video** in Android apps — built entirely with **Jetpack Compose**.

This library provides **only the UI layer**, giving you full control over playback, timing, and processing logic. Whether you're using **ExoPlayer**, **FFmpeg**, or custom media handling, MediaTrimmer UI integrates as the frontend trimming interface.

## 🚀 Quick Start

For simple audio trimming:

```kotlin
val trimmerState = rememberMediaTrimmerState()

MediaTrimmer(state = trimmerState)
```

To customize visuals, use the `trackContent` slot:

```kotlin
MediaTrimmer(
    state = trimmerState,
    trackContent = {
        MyCustomTrackRenderer(state = trimmerState)
    },
    colors = TrimmerDefaults.colors(
        containerBackgroundColor = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.surface,
        handleColor = Color.Red,
    )
)
```

For video trimming with thumbnails + ExoPlayer:

```kotlin
val player = ExoPlayer.Builder(context).build()
// configure media item...

val trimmerState = rememberMediaTrimmerStateWithPlayer(player)

MediaTrimmer(
    state = trimmerState,
    trackContent = {
        DefaultVideoThumbnails(
            videoUri = yourVideoUri,
            state = trimmerState
        )
    }
)
```
